		<h2> Notes on Symplectic Topology </h2>
		<div>
			<span>
				These notes are summaries of a book "Introduction to Symplectic Topology", written by Dusa McDuff and Dietmar Salamon. <br/>
				The purpose is to make myself read this book, and the notes would be uploaded somewhat slowly but steadily.<br/>
				The notes are written in Korean, so you might use these to study Korean language. <br/>
				The contents will also be uploaded in a facebook page "JJM Math".<br/>
				Subscribe <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JJMmath">JJM Math</a> if you want. <br/>
